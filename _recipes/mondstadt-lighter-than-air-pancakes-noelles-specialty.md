Noelle's specialty. These thick pastries are the special afternoon snacks of the Knights of Favonius. They give people the sense that they have fallen upon a layer of fluffy clouds, and seeing Noelle's smile makes the feeling all the sweeter!

## I﻿ngredients

#### Pancake

**Part A**

* 2 1/2 Cups AP Flour 
* 3 Tbsp Sugar 
* 2 tsp Salt 
* 1 tsp Baking Powder 
* 1 tsp Baking Soda 

**Part B**

* 2 1/2 Cups Buttermilk 
* 2 Egg Yolks 
* 1/2 Cup Butter 

**Part C**

* 2 Egg Whites (Whisked to Meringue)  

#### \
Whipped Cream

**Part D**

* 1L Whipping Cream 
* 2 Tbsp Icing Sugar  
* 1 Tbsp Vanilla Extract 



## M﻿ethod

1.) Combine PART A and mix thoroughly.

2.) In a separate bowl, mix together PART B.

3.) Whisk PART C until it forms a stiff meringue.

4.) Combine PART A and PART B, gently folding with a spatula. Do not overfold.

5.) Pour in PART C and fold again, creating clumps for air bubbles that will make the pancakes fluffy. Let the batter rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.

6.) In another bowl, combine PART D and whisk until it forms a stiff peak.

7.) Heat a pan on low-medium heat and add butter. Take 5oz of the batter and place onto the pan, spreading it out. Cook for 3 minutes until the batter starts to bubble on top, then flip and turn up the heat to medium-high and cook for 1-2 minutes. 

8.) To plate, layer pancakes, cream, and chocolate syrup into stacks. After a large stack, create a chocolate design on top and finish with a raspberry and crepe mint.
