Eula's specialty. It's hard to say if the fang-like crescent shape is meant to flout tradition or express her "tooth for tooth" ethos. A salty, fresh, smoked flavor emanates from under the golden outer crust, its body and intensity likely unmatched by anyone else in Mondstadt. Best not to tell her that, though, lest she "remember" it.
